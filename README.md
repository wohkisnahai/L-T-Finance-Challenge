# Farmer Income Prediction – L&T Machine Learning Case Study

This project was developed as part of the **L&T Machine Learning Case Study competition**.  
The goal was to build a predictive model to estimate **farmer income** based on landholding, demographics, and socio-economic indicators.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict farmer income using machine learning techniques.  
- **Approach:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.  
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor.  
- **Outcome:** Achieved **R² score of 0.94** and **MAPE of 23.6%** on the validation set.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contained information on:
- Landholding size  
- Demographic attributes  
- Socio-economic indicators  
- Target variable: **Total Income**  

> *Note: Dataset was provided as part of the competition and is not publicly available.*

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing and non-numeric values in the income column.  
   - Converted categorical values into usable formats.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and outlier detection.  

3. **Data Splitting**
   - Train set: Records with known income.  
   - Test set: Records with missing income.  

4. **Model Development**
   - Baseline models tested: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor.  
   - Final model: **Random Forest Regressor** (best performance).  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: R² Score, MAPE.  
   - Final Model → **R²: 0.94, MAPE: 23.6%**
